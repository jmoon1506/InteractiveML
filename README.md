# Interactive Machine Learning.

Capstone Project for the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Master's at UC Berkeley. This project generates human-readable visualizations of the layers of neural networks. It combines a generative adversarial network with Monte Carlo sampling of stochastic gradient descent to achieve fast resolution with realistic images.
